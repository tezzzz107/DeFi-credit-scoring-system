## Feature Importance Analysis

### Top Predictive Features

1. **borrow_ratio (64.5%)** - Most critical factor
   - Indicates active credit utilization
   - Distinguishes between lenders and borrowers
   - Higher ratios (with repayment) = higher scores

2. **volume_concentration (9.8%)** - Risk indicator
   - Measures transaction size distribution
   - High concentration = potential manipulation
   - Diversified volume = healthier profile

3. **activity_duration_days (7.8%)** - Consistency measure
   - Long-term engagement indicates reliability
   - Sporadic activity suggests higher risk
   - Predictive of future behavior

4. **is_balanced_user (4.6%)** - Behavioral classifier
   - Balanced users show protocol mastery
   - Single-action users may be specialized/risky
   - Strong positive correlation with high scores

### Feature Correlation Insights

- **Positive Correlations**: Long activity duration + high transaction count + balanced actions
- **Negative Correlations**: High bot scores + volume concentration + liquidation ratios
- **Neutral Factors**: Asset diversity shows mixed correlation (quality over quantity)
