# DeFi-credit-scoring-system
DeFi Credit Scoring System for Aave V2
Overview
This system analyzes Aave V2 transaction data to generate credit scores (0-1000) for wallet addresses, identifying reliable users and flagging risky or bot-like behavior. The scoring methodology combines behavioral analysis, risk assessment, and machine learning to provide transparent, actionable credit evaluations.
Quick Start
bash# Install dependencies
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn

# Run the scorer
python defi_credit_scorer.py
Scoring Methodology
Feature Engineering (25+ Features)
The system extracts comprehensive behavioral indicators from raw transaction data:
Activity Metrics

Transaction volume and frequency
Average/median transaction sizes
Activity duration and consistency
Time between transactions

Behavioral Patterns

Action distribution (deposit/borrow/repay/redeem/liquidation ratios)
Asset diversification score
User type classification (balanced, lender-only, etc.)
Transaction regularity analysis

Risk Indicators

Liquidation event frequency
Volume concentration risk
Transaction size volatility
Bot-like behavior detection

Credit Score Components
Positive Factors (+150 to +200 points)

Balanced lending/borrowing activity
Regular repayment behavior
High transaction volume
Long-term protocol engagement
Asset diversification
Consistent activity patterns

Negative Factors (-100 to -200 points)

High liquidation risk
Bot-like behavior patterns
Extreme volume concentration
High transaction volatility
Irregular or suspicious patterns

Bot Detection Algorithm
The system identifies potential bot behavior through:

Timing Analysis: Detecting unnaturally regular transaction intervals
Pattern Recognition: Identifying repetitive transaction amounts
Frequency Analysis: Flagging unusually high transaction rates
Diversity Metrics: Assessing limited action variety

Model Architecture
Algorithm: Random Forest Regressor

Rationale: Handles non-linear relationships and feature interactions well
Interpretability: Provides feature importance rankings
Robustness: Resistant to outliers and missing values

Training Process:

Feature engineering from transaction data
Synthetic target generation based on DeFi best practices
Model training with cross-validation
Performance evaluation (RMSE, R²)

Key Features
1. Transaction Analysis

Volume Metrics: Total and average transaction values
Frequency Patterns: Time-based activity analysis
Asset Diversity: Multi-asset engagement scoring

2. Behavioral Classification

Balanced Users: Active in multiple DeFi activities
Lender-Only: Primarily deposit/lending focused
High-Risk: Frequent liquidations or suspicious patterns

3. Risk Assessment

Liquidation Risk: Based on historical liquidation events
Volatility Risk: Transaction size and timing variations
Concentration Risk: Over-reliance on single assets or large transactions

4. Bot Detection

Temporal Patterns: Identifying mechanical timing
Amount Patterns: Detecting repetitive transaction sizes
Behavioral Anomalies: Flagging non-human-like activity

Validation & Extensibility
Model Validation

Cross-validation: 80/20 train-test split
Performance Metrics: RMSE and R² scoring
Feature Importance: Ranked feature contributions
Outlier Detection: Automated anomaly flagging

Extensibility Options

Additional Protocols: Extend to Compound, MakerDAO, etc.
Multi-chain Support: Add Ethereum, BSC, Arbitrum data
Real-time Scoring: Implement streaming updates
Advanced Models: Gradient boosting, neural networks
External Data: Incorporate token prices, market conditions

Production Considerations

Labeled Data: Replace synthetic targets with real credit outcomes
Model Retraining: Regular updates with new transaction data
Monitoring: Track score distribution and model drift
Explainability: Enhanced feature contribution analysis

Limitations & Assumptions

Synthetic Targets: Uses rule-based scoring for training (replace with real labels)
Limited History: Scores based solely on Aave V2 transactions
Static Features: No real-time market condition integration
No Identity: Cannot link wallets to real-world identities

Technical Requirements

Python 3.7+
pandas, numpy, scikit-learn
Input: JSON file with transaction data
Output: Ranked credit scores with explanations

This system provides a foundation for DeFi credit assessment that can be adapted and extended for various protocols and use cases while maintaining transparency and interpretability.
